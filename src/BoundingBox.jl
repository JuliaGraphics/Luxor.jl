The BoundingBox type holds two Points, `corner1` and `corner2`.

    BoundingBox(s::AbstractString)  # the bounding box of a text string

`BoundingBox(;centered=true)` returns a BoundingBox the same size and position as the current drawing, assuming
the origin (0, 0) is at the center.

The `centered` option defaults to `true`, and assumes the drawing is currently
centered. If `false`, the function assumes that the origin is at the top left
of the drawing. So this function doesn't really work if the current matrix has
been modified (by `translate()`, `scale()`, `rotate()` etc.)
