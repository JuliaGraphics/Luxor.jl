Draw a line between two points and add an arrowhead at the end. The arrowhead length will be
the length of the side of the arrow's head, and the arrowhead angle is the angle between the
sloping side of the arrowhead and the arrow's shaft.

Arrows don't use the current linewidth setting (`setline()`), and defaults to 1, but you can
specify another value. It doesn't need stroking/filling, the shaft is stroked and the
head filled with the current color.
