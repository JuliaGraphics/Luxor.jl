# The drawing model

The underlying drawing model is that you build paths, and
these are filled and/or stroked, using the current *graphics
state*, which specifies colors, line thicknesses, scale,
orientation, opacity, and so on.

You can modify the current graphics state by
transforming/rotating/scaling it, setting color and style
parameters, and so on. Subsequent graphics use the new
state, but the graphics you've already drawn are unchanged.

Many of the drawing functions have an *action* argument,
supplied either as a symbol argument (eg `:fill`) or as a
keyword argument (eg `action=:fill`). This action determines
what happens to the current path. It can be  `:fill`,
`:stroke`, `:fillstroke`, `:fillpreserve`,
`:strokepreserve`, `:clip`, or `:path`. The default is
usually `:path`, ie. add the graphics to the current path.

The main Julia data types you'll encounter in Luxor are:

| Name of type      | Purpose |
| ---               | ---     |
| Drawing           | holds the current drawing |
| Point             | specifies 2D points |
| BoundingBox       | defines a bounding box |
| Table             | defines a table with different column widths and row  heights |
| Partition         | defines a table defined by cell width and height |
| Tiler             | defines a rectangular grid of tiles |
| BezierPathSegment | a Bezier path segment defined by 4 points |
| BezierPath        | contains a series of BezierPathSegments |
| GridRect          | defines a rectangular grid |
| GridHex           | defines a hexagonal grid |
| Scene             | used to define a scene for an animation |
| Turtle            | represents a turtle for drawing turtle graphics |
| Path              | contains a complete path |

## Points and coordinates

You specify points on the drawing surface using `Point(x, y)`.

The default _origin_ (ie the `x = 0, y = 0` point) is at the
top left corner: the x axis runs left to right across the
page, and the y axis runs top to bottom down the page, so Y
coordinates increase downwards.

By default, `Point(0, 100)` is below `Point(0, 0)`.

```@setup origin_demo
using Luxor
svgimage = @drawsvg begin
sethue("antiquewhite")
box(boxtopleft(BoundingBox() + (40, 40)), boxbottomright(BoundingBox() - (40, 40)), :fill)
translate(boxtopleft(BoundingBox() + (40, 40)))
sethue("black")
circle(Point(0, 0), 6, :fill)
label("(0, 0)", :se, Point(0, 0), offset=15)
circle(Point(0, 100), 6, :fill)
label("(0, 100)", :se, Point(0, 100), offset=15)
rulers()
end
```

```@example origin_demo
svgimage # hide
```

!!! note

    Although this is the preferred coordinate system for most computer graphics software, including Luxor and Cairo, but mathematicians and scientists may well be used to the other convention, where the origin is in the center of the drawing and the y-axis increases up the page. See the macros such as [`@png`](@ref), [`@svg`](@ref), and [`@pdf`](@ref) which will put the origin at the center for you.

You can reposition the origin at any time, using [`origin`](@ref). The 'user space' can be modified by functions such as [`scale`](@ref), [`translate`](@ref), and [`rotate`](@ref), or more directly using matrix transforms.

The Point type holds two coordinates, `x` and `y`. For example:

```julia
julia> P = Point(12.0, 13.0)
Luxor.Point(12.0, 13.0)

julia> P.x
12.0

julia> P.y
13.0
```

Points are immutable, so you can't change P's x or y values directly. But it's easy to make new points based on existing ones.

Points can be added together:

```julia
julia> Q = Point(4, 5)
Luxor.Point(4.0, 5.0)

julia> P + Q
Luxor.Point(16.0, 18.0)
```

You can add and multiply Points and scalars:

```julia
julia> 10P
Luxor.Point(120.0, 130.0)

julia> P + 100
Luxor.Point(112.0, 113.0)
```

You can also make new points by mixing Points and tuples:

```julia
julia> P + (10, 0)
Luxor.Point(22.0, 13.0)

julia> Q * (0.5, 0.5)
Luxor.Point(2.0, 2.5)
```

You can also create points from tuples:

```julia
julia> Point((1.0, 14))
Point(1.0, 14.0)

julia> plist = (1.0, 2.0), (-10, 10), (14.2, 15.4);

julia> Point.(plist)
3-element Array{Point,1}:
 Point(1.0, 2.0)
 Point(-10.0, 10.0)
 Point(14.2, 15.4)
```

You can use the letter **O** as a shortcut to refer to the
current Origin, `Point(0, 0)`. Most coding fonts clearly
show the difference between the letter `O` and the digit `0`.

```@example
using Luxor # hide
Drawing(600, 300, "../assets/figures/point-ex.png") # hide
background("white") # hide
origin() # hide
sethue("blue") # hide
rulers()
box.([O + (i, 0) for i in range(0, stop=200, length=5)], 20, 20, :stroke)
finish() # hide
nothing # hide
```

![point example](../assets/figures/point-ex.png)

Angles are usually supplied in radians, measured starting at the positive x-axis turning towards the positive y-axis (which usually points 'down' the page or canvas). So rotations look ‘clockwise’. (The main exception is for turtle graphics, which conventionally let you supply angles in degrees.)

Coordinates are usually interpreted as PostScript points, where a point is 1/72 of an inch, or as pixels, at a DPI of 72ppi.

Because Julia allows you to combine numbers and variables directly, you can supply units with dimensions and have them converted to points (assuming the current scale is 1:1):

- inch (`in` is unavailable, being used by `for` syntax)
- cm   (centimeters)
- mm   (millimeters)

For example:

```julia
rect(Point(20mm, 2cm), 5inch, (22/7)inch, :fill)
```

# The drawing surface

The [`origin`](@ref) function moves the 0/0 point to the center of the drawing. It's often convenient to do this at the beginning of a program.

You can use functions like [`scale`](@ref), [`rotate`](@ref), and [`translate`](@ref) to change the coordinate system.

[`background`](@ref) fills the drawing with a color, covering any previous contents. By default, PDF drawings have a white background, whereas PNG drawings have no background so that the background appears transparent in other applications. If there is a current clipping region, [`background`](@ref) fills just that region. In the next example, the first [`background`](@ref) fills the entire drawing with magenta, but the calls in the loop fill only the active clipping region, a table cell defined by the `Table` iterator:

```@example
using Luxor # hide
Drawing(600, 400, "../assets/figures/backgrounds.png") # hide
background("magenta")
origin()
table = Table(5, 5, 100, 50)
for (pos, n) in table
    box(pos,
        table.colwidths[table.currentcol],
        table.rowheights[table.currentrow],
        :clip)
    background(randomhue()...)
    clipreset()
end
finish() # hide
nothing # hide
```

![background](../assets/figures/backgrounds.png)

The [`rulers`](@ref) function draws a couple of rulers to indicate the position and orientation of the current axes.

```@example
using Luxor # hide
Drawing(400, 400, "../assets/figures/axes.png") # hide
background("gray80")
origin()
rulers()
finish() # hide
nothing # hide
```

![axes](../assets/figures/axes.png)

# Save and restore: layers and state

[`gsave`](@ref) saves a copy of the current graphics settings (current axis rotation, position, scale, line and text settings, color, and so on). When the next [`grestore`](@ref) is called, all changes you've made to the graphics settings will be discarded, and the previous settings are restored, so things return to how they were when you last used [`gsave`](@ref). [`gsave`](@ref) and [`grestore`](@ref) should always be balanced in pairs, enclosing the functions.

The `@layer` macro is a synonym for a [`gsave`](@ref)...[`grestore`](@ref) pair.

```julia
@svg begin
    circle(Point(0, 0), 100, :stroke)
    @layer (sethue("red"); rule(Point(0, 0)); rule(O, π/2))
    circle(Point(0, 0), 200, :stroke)
end
```

or

```julia
@svg begin
    circle(Point(0, 0), 100, :stroke)
    @layer begin
        sethue("red")
        rule(Point(0, 0))
        rule(Point(0, 0), pi/2)
    end
    circle(Point(0, 0), 200, :stroke)
end
```

## Return the current drawing

In some situations you'll want to explicitly return the current drawing to the calling function. Use [`currentdrawing`](@ref) or assign the result of `Drawing()` to a variable.

# Working in IDEs and notebooks

You can use an environment such as a Jupyter or Pluto notebook or the Juno or VS Code IDEs, and load Luxor at the start of a session. The first drawing will take a few seconds, because the Cairo graphics engine needs to warm up. Subsequent drawings are then much quicker. (This is true of much graphics and plotting work. Julia compiles each function when it first encounters it, and then calls the compiled versions for the rest of the session.)

# SVG images

Luxor can create new SVG images, either in a file or in
memory, and can also place existing SVG images on a drawing.
See [Placing images](@ref) for more. It's also possible to
obtain the source of the current SVG drawing as a string. For example,
this code draws the Julia logo using SVG code and stores the SVG in `s`:

```julia
Drawing(500, 500, :svg)
origin()
julialogo()
finish()
s = svgstring()
```

You can now examine the SVG elements in `s` programmatically:

```julia
eachmatch(r"rgb\(.*?\)", s) |> collect
5-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("rgb(0%,0%,0%)")
 RegexMatch("rgb(79.6%,23.5%,20%)")
 RegexMatch("rgb(25.1%,38.8%,84.7%)")
 RegexMatch("rgb(58.4%,34.5%,69.8%)")
 RegexMatch("rgb(22%,59.6%,14.9%)")
```
