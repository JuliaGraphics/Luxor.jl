# Paths versus polygons

When drawing in Luxor you'll usually be creating _paths_ and
_polygons_. It can be easy to confuse the two.

## Drawing graphics as paths

Luxor draws graphics onto the current drawing using paths.

There's always a current path. It starts off being empty.

A path can contain one or more sequences of straight lines
and Bézier curves. You add straight lines to the current
path using functions like `line()`, and add Bezier curves
using functions like `curve()`. You can can continue the
path at a different location of the drawing using `move()`.

Cairo keeps track of the current path, the current point,
and the current graphics state (color, line thickness, and
so on), in response to the functions you call.

This code creates a single path consisting of three separate
shapes - a line, a rectangular box, and a circle:

```
function make_path()
    move(Point(-220, 50))
    line(Point(-170, -50))
    line(Point(-120, 50))
    move(Point(0, 0))
    box(O, 100, 100, :path)
    move(Point(180, 0) + polar(40, 0)) # pt on circumference
    circle(Point(180, 0), 40, :path)
end
```

```@setup pathexample
using Luxor

function make_path()
    move(Point(-220, 50))
    line(Point(-170, -50))
    line(Point(-120, 50))
    move(Point(0, 0))
    box(O, 100, 100, :path)
    move(Point(180, 0) + polar(40, 0))
    circle(Point(180, 0), 40, :path)
end

d = @drawsvg begin
    background("antiquewhite")

    sethue("rebeccapurple")
    translate(0, -120)
    make_path()
    strokepath()

    translate(0, 120)
    sethue("orange")
    make_path()
    fillpath()

    translate(0, 120)
    make_path()
    clip()
    sethue("green")
    rule.(between.(O - (250, 0), O + (250, 0), 0:0.01:1), -π/3)
    end 800 500
```

```@example pathexample
d # hide
```

The [`move()`](@ref) function as used here is essentially a "pick up
the pen and move it elsewhere" instruction.

The `circle()` function creates four Bezier curves that provide a good approximation to a circle.

The top path, in purple, is drawn when
[`strokepath()`](@ref) is applied to this path. Each of the
three shapes is stroked with the same current settings
(color, line thickness, dash pattern, and so on).

The middle row shows a duplicate of this path, and
[`fillpath()`](@ref) has been applied to fill each of
the three shapes in the path with orange.

The duplicate path at the bottom has been followed by
the [`clip()`](@ref) function and then by
[`rule()`](@ref) to draw green ruled lines, which are
clipped by the outlines of the shapes in the path.

You can construct paths using functions like [`move()`](@ref),
[`line()`](@ref), [`arc()`](@ref), and [`curve()`](@ref), plus any Luxor function
that lets you specify the `:path` ("add to path") action as a
keyword argument or parameter.

Many functions in Luxor have an `action` keyword argument or
parameter. If you want to add that shape to the current
path, use `:path`. If you want to both add the shape _and_
finish and draw the current path, use one of `stroke`,
`fill`, etc.  

After the path is stroked or filled, it's emptied out, ready
for you to start over again. But you can also use one of the
'-preserve' varsions, [`fillpreserve()`](@ref)/`:fillpreserve` or
[`strokepreserve()`](@ref)/`:strokepreserve` to continue working
with the current defined path after drawing it. You can
convert the path to a clipping path using
`:clip`/[`clip()`](@ref).

A single path can contain multiple separate graphic shapes.
These can make holes. If you want a path to contain holes,
you add the hole shapes to the current path after reversing
their direction. For example, to put a square hole inside a
circle, first create a circular shape, then draw a square
shape inside, making sure that the square runs in the
opposite direction to the circle. When you finally draw the
path, the interior shape forms a hole.

```@example
using Luxor # hide
d = @drawsvg begin # hide
background("antiquewhite") # hide
sethue("purple")
circle(O, 200, :path)
box(O, 100, 100, :path, reversepath=true)
fillpath()
end 800 500 # hide
d # hide
```

If you're constructing the path from simple path commands,
this is easy, and the functions that provide a `reversepath`
keyword argument can help. If not, you can do things like
this:

```
circle(O, 100, :path)                 # add a circle to the current path
poly(reverse(box(O, 50, 50)), :path)  # create polygon, add to current path after reversing
fillpath()                            # finally fill the two-part path
```

Many methods, including [`box()`](@ref), [`crescent()`](@ref),
[`ellipse()`](@ref), [`epitrochoid()`](@ref),
[`hypotrochoid()`](@ref), [`ngon()`](@ref),
[`polycross()`](@ref), [`rect()`](@ref),
[`squircle()`](@ref), and [`star()`](@ref), offer a
`vertices` keyword argument. With these you can specify
`vertices=true` to return a list of points _instead of_
constructing a path.

Note that methods to functions might vary in how they
operate: whereas `box(Point(0, 0), 50, 50)` returns a
polygon (a list of points), `box(Point(0, 0), 50, 50,
:path)` adds a rectangle to the current path _and_ returns a
polygon. However, `box(Point(0, 0), 50, 50, 5 ... )`
constructs a path with Bézier-curved corners, so this
method doesn't return any vertex information - you'll have
to flatten the Béziers via [`getpathflat()`](@ref) or
obtain the path with intact Béziers via
[`getpath()`](@ref).

## Path objects

Sometimes it's useful to be able to store a path, rather
than just construct it on the drawing. It might also be
useful to draw it later, under different circumstances, and
perhaps more than once. To do this, you can use the `storepath()`
and `drawpath()` functions.

Consider this code that uses `storepath()`:

```julia
move(Point(-220, 50))
line(Point(-170, -50))
line(Point(-120, 50))
move(Point(0, 0))
box(O, 100, 100, :path)
move(Point(180, 0) + polar(40, 0)) # pt on circumference
circle(Point(180, 0), 40, :path)

pathexample = storepath() # save Path
```

`pathexample` now contains the path, stored in a Luxor object of type `Path`. The current path is still present.

```
julia> pathexample
Path([
 PathMove(Point(-220.0, 50.0)),
 PathLine(Point(-170.0, -50.0)),
 PathLine(Point(-120.0, 50.0)),
 PathMove(Point(-50.0, 50.0)),
 PathLine(Point(-50.0, -50.0)),
 PathLine(Point(50.0, -50.0)),
 PathLine(Point(50.0, 50.0)),
 PathClose(),
 PathMove(Point(220.0, 0.0)),
 PathCurve(Point(220.0, 22.08984375), Point(202.08984375, 40.0), Point(180.0, 40.0)),
 PathCurve(Point(157.91015625, 40.0), Point(140.0, 22.08984375), Point(140.0, 0.0)),
 PathCurve(Point(140.0, -22.08984375), Point(157.91015625, -40.0), Point(180.0, -40.0)),
 PathCurve(Point(202.08984375, -40.0), Point(220.0, -22.08984375), Point(220.0, 0.0))
])
```

It's now possible to draw this stored path at a later time. For example, this code builds a path, saves it as `pathexample`, then draws a number of rotated copies:

```@example
using Luxor
d = @draw begin
    move(Point(-220, 50))
    line(Point(-170, -50))
    line(Point(-120, 50))
    move(Point(0, 0))
    box(O, 100, 100, :path)
    move(Point(180, 0) + polar(40, 0))
    circle(Point(180, 0), 40, :path)

    pathexample = storepath() # store the path

    rotate(-π/2)
    for i in -200:50:200
        @layer begin
            randomhue()
            translate(0, i)
            drawpath(pathexample, :stroke)
        end
    end
end
d # hide
```

## Polygons

A polygon appears as a plain Vector (Array) of `Point`s.
There are no lines or curves, just 2D coordinates in the
form of `Point`s. When a polygon is eventually drawn, it's
converted into a path, and the points are usually connected
with short straight lines.

One important difference between polygons and paths is that
paths can contain Bezier curves.

The [`pathtopoly()`](@ref) function extracts the current
path that Cairo is in the process of constructing and
returns an array of Vectors of points - a set of one or more
polygons (remember that a single path can contain multiple
shapes). Internally this function uses
[`getpathflat()`](@ref), which is similar to
[`getpath()`](@ref) but it returns a Cairo path object in
which all Bézier curve segments have been reduced to
sequences of short straight lines.

So:

```
circle(O, 100, :path)
p = pathtopoly()
poly(first(p), :stroke)
```

is more or less equivalent to:

```
ngon(O, 100, 129, 0, :stroke)    # a 129agon with radius 100
```

Luxor draws as many short straight lines as necessary (here
about 129) so as to render the curve smooth at reasonable
magnifications.
