- polyintersect()
- polytriangulate()

- in(pt, bb) aliases isinside(pt, bb)
- texttrack() does line-spacing
- @eps macro

### Changed

### Removed

### Deprecated

- polytriangulate!() -> polytriangulate()

## [v1.5.0] - July 25 2019

### Added

- `polyreflect!()`

- `polyscale!()` now can do scaling in h and v separately

- `pointcrossesboundingbox()` does something

- `mask()` does rectangular areas too

- `textbox()` and `textwrap()` return a position

- `rule()` has `vertices` option to return points rather than draw lines

### Changed

- `textwrap()` no longer inserts a blank line at the top

### Removed

### Deprecated

### Added

- another method for `ellipse()` that takes three points
- `insertvertices!(pgon)` inserts a vertex into every edge of a polygon

### Removed

### Deprecated

## [v1.3.0] - April 28 2019

### Added

- use Project.toml

- dimension() for dimensioning

- polymove!(), polyrotate!(), polyscale!() for really changing polygons

- intersectionlines() replaces intersection()

- animate() has new option to choose ffmpeg command

- Bezier (bidirectional) `arrow` method added

- Bezier easing function, `easeinoutbezier()` takes two normalized control points to control easing when animating

- arc2sagitta()/carc2sagitta() functions added

- isarcclockwise() added

- pointinverse() added

### Changed

- functions that used intersection() now use intersectionlines()

- more functions return points or arrays (or true) rather than unions of Booleans/points or nothing

- rescale(x, a, b) defaults to rescale(x, a, b, 0.0, 1.0)

- the `@pdf`, `@png`, and `@svg` macros allow you to omit the suffix/file extension

- All the noise-related code has been replaced. I discovered that the algorithm was patent-encumbered, so I've switched over to the OpenSimplexNoise algorithm. The advantage is that there's now 4D simplex noise. The disadvantages are that the new code is currently a bit slower, and (obviously) all the actual noise values produced for a specific set of inputs will be slightly different from v1.2.0. The file `src/patentednoise.jl` contains the old noise code.

### Removed

- much noise-related code

- polyselfintersections() removed, it didn't work at all

- REQUIRE

### Deprecated

- intersection() is deprecated, in favour of intersectionlines(). It should be
more reliable, and has fewer options/special cases for collinearity.
